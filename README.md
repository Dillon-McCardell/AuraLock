# AuraLock
### AuraLock is a facial recognition door lock project with an integrated Android Mobile App
This project began as a solution to a fairly common problem: Oneâ€™s inability to quickly open their home door while carrying multiple items. Whether we are carrying two trips worth of groceries, or simply fumbling around with a phone, entering our home can become a serious annoyance. AuraLock is a project designed to alleviate the need for keys or even fingerprints, resulting in a truly hands-free entry experience, all while maintaining 24/7 security for you and your family.

This repo contains the software running on the Raspberry Pi within the Lock Hardware.
